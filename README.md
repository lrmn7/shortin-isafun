![Shortin Url - LRMN](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091192083852828744/1108785976458879098/Screenshot_2023-05-18_at_22-59-15_L_RMN_Shortin_Personalized_Link_Shortener.png)

## What I'm use here?

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for HTTP Request.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) for Form Validation. I know it's too OP here, but I want to understand this library more, LOL.

## How to use it?

- It's basically like [Tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com) when you want to shorten a long url.
- Open [shortin](https://shortin.is-a.fun/).
- Input the long url that you want to make it short. You also can set the custom alias if you want.
- Then click the submit button if you want to make it short. TADA....

## Future Improvement

- [X] Add Regex validation for the long url input
- [X] Modularize the related components if needed.
- [X] Use modal dialog as a confirmation and display the link result there.
- [X] Update error message in modal.
- [X] Implement unit testing based on [Next.Js Docs about testing](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing).
